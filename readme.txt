Accept all major credit cards directly on your WooCommerce site via this seamless and secure WooCommerce gateway.

== Description ==

Exalt Commerce is the all-in-one solution that allows you to turn your beautiful WooCommerce backed shopping experience into a selling machine.  This WooCommerce gateway plugin, combined with a [merchant account](http://www.Exaltcommerce.com/woocommerce/ "merchant account") from Exalt Commerce, will allow you to accept transactions from all major credit cards including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, Diners Club, and JCB.  

Using Exalt Commerce's innovative and secure [.pay™ developer framework](http://www.getdotpay.com ".pay"), this plugin supports both card storage as well as integration with the WooCommerce subscriptions module.  Exalt Commerce meets the highest standards of security and reliability and is PCI Level 1 compliant.  

= For US Based Merchants =
You will need to setup a [credit card processing account with Exalt Commerce](http://www.Exaltcommerce.com/woocommerce/ "credit card processing account with Exalt Commerce").  This account will allow you to accept payments from anyone in the world using all major card brands.  There is no processing minimum volume for US based merchants.  Account setup typically takes two to three business days.  Details are available on the [Exalt Commerce website](http://www.Exalt.com/woocommerce/ "Exalt Commerce website").

= For Merchants outside of the US =
At this time, because of the complexity of international credit card processing, we are only accepting applicants for merchants that process over $40,000 USD per month for the WooCommerce Payment Gateway.  We can handle processing in most currencies throughout the world, but do require European business registration in most cases.  Please contact [Exalt Commerce](http://www.Exaltcommerce.com/contact-us/ "Exalt Commerce") for more information.
